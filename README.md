Prototyping repository for DB API

At this point very much experimental approach. Considering the REST API logic would be 
implemented directly on PostgreSQL database and the actual API endpoints autogenerated via 
PostgREST.

## Authentication and Authorisation

Authentication JWT would need to be generated by EDC system. 
Thinking that token payload will contain:

- role
- exp
- user type
- study (optional, when token for study operation requested)
- study role (optional, when token for study operation requested)

On DB level:

- authenticator role: connects to DB
- web_anon: anonymous access to web services
- web_auth: authenticated access to web services
 
## API versioning
  
Schemas:

- public: not exposed internal EDC system tables
- wsauth: maybe needed to keep authorisation utilities
- wsv1: exposed API functions (V1)
